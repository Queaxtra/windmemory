## How to Contribute a Prompt?
This website is an open-source project, [queaxtra/windmemory](https://github.com/queaxtra/windmemory). Everyone can contribute.

If you want to add a new prompt, just open a new page on GitHub under “Issues” and write the prompt you want to add. I will try to add all prompts to the system as much as I can.
